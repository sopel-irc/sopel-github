## Changelog

### 0.5.0

This is the first release named `sopel-github`. Previous versions of this plugin
were known as `sopel_modules.github`, and are still available from PyPI for
users running Sopel 7.x or older.

Added:
* Support for inline references to issues/PRs from _any_ repo (#125)
* Timestamps in issue, PR, and comment output (#126)
* Configurable skipping of short inline issue/PR numbers (#137)
  * This is to help bot owners deal with e.g. people talking about their `#1`
    _something_ and the bot posts your project's first issue.

* Modernized for newer Sopel versions (#110, #138)
* Send version header to GitHub API (#122)

* Unicode ellipsis now used instead of three periods (#31)
* Oxford comma now used in generated lists (#40)

    the potential for failed deliveries, as GitHub's webhook delivery service
    times out very quickly

Fixed:
* GitHub URL regexes should match all possible usernames & repo names (#38)
  * Of particular note: dots (`.`) are now recognized in repository links,
    such as Sopel's website repo: https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel.chat
