Changes in 0.2.0a2
==================

Fixed:
* Polymorphism is hard in label/assignee events (getting the PR number caused
  errors because sometimes GitHub *does* use `pull_request` instead of `issue`)

Changes in 0.2.0a1
==================

Added:
* Handle label & assignee events for PRs too, not just issues (#23)

Changed:
* Edits to review comments also ignored (#24)

Changes in 0.2.0a0
==================

Added:
* Conversion of :emoji: to Unicode emoji in some places, if the required
  library is installed (#17)
* Handling of PR reviews and release events (#20, #21)

Changed:
* Merged PRs are now distinct from closed PRs (#18)
* Grammar updated, mostly around comment-type notifications (#15)
* Edits to existing comments are ignored (no more duplicates) (#16)


Changes in 0.1.5
================

Fixed:
* Refactoring unintentionally broke registering new repo webhooks (#14)

Meta:
* PyPI package description should be rendered to HTML now (fixed content-type)


Changes in 0.1.4
================

Changed:
* "GitHub" is now properly capitalized everywhere in text output. (#9)
* Usage output uses `help_prefix` from config instead of hardcoded `.` (#12)

Fixed:

Changes in 0.1.3
================

Meta:
* Moved to Sopel organization on Github; new maintainer.

Changed:
* Uses requests instead of deprecated sopel.web functions. (Sopel itself
  requires requests, so we don't have to.)
* Fetched git.io links use HTTPS now.
